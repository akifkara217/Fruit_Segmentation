# Fruit Segmentation

Different traditional segmentation methods were used in the project and evaluated with different success metrics. The working mechanisms of success metrics were examined. The kernel sizes of the segmentation methods were changed and their effects on the success rate were examined. In addition, combinations of different methods were tried and the results were recorded.
